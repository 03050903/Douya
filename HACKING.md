# Hacking

You need a valid pair of API key and secret to make requests to Douban API.

## Get your API key and secret

Currently Douban has [closed API key application for individuals](https://developers.douban.com/apikey/), so you have to get your own from somewhere else.

Of course I'm absolutely not recommending you to get one by [decompiling](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk) [an old enough version of the official app](https://apkpure.com/%E8%B1%86%E7%93%A3/com.douban.frodo).

## Fill in the credentials

Once you've got the credentials, you need to provide them to Douya. Put the following files on you SD card:

- `(Your SD card path)/Douya/API_KEY`: The content of which should be an API key for Douban.
- `(Your SD card path)/Douya/API_SECRET`: The content of which should be an API secret for Douban.

The path and file names are case sensitive.

## Get the app!

Download and install the app from [the latest release](https://github.com/DreaminginCodeZH/Douya/releases/latest).
