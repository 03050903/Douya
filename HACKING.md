# Hacking

You need a valid pair of API key and secret to make requests to Douban API.

## Get your API key and secret

Currently Douban has [closed API key application for individuals](https://developers.douban.com/apikey/), so you have to get your own from somewhere else.

Of course I'm not recommending you to [decompile](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk) [the official app](http://www.douban.com/doubanapp/redirect?download=Android) for this.

## Fill in the credentials

Once you've got the credentials, you need to provide them to Douya. Put the following files on you SD card:

- `(Your SD card path)/Douya/API_KEY`: The content of which should be an API key for Douban.
- `(Your SD card path)/Douya/API_SECRET`: The content of which should be an API secret for Douban.

The path and file names are case sensitive.

## Get the app!

Download and install the app from [the latest release](https://github.com/DreaminginCodeZH/Douya/releases/latest).
